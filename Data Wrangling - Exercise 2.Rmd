## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#Load data "titanic_original" 

titanic_original <- read.csv("C:/Users/kiriakosc/Documents/R/titanic_original.csv", header=TRUE)
```

```{r}

#1) Find missing values in "embarked column" replace with an S

titanic_clean <- titanic_original %>%
  
  mutate(
    
    embarked = replace(embarked, embarked == "", "S"), 
    
#2) replace NA in Age to the mean of age     
    age = replace(age, is.na(age), round(mean(age, na.rm=TRUE))),

#3) replace NA values in Lifeboat  
    boat = replace(boat, boat == "", NA),

#4) Cabin: if there is not a cabin number associated, it is possible that the person had survived
    has_cabin_number = ifelse(cabin == "", 0,1)
  )

```

```{r}

write.csv(titanic_clean, file = "titanic_clean.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
